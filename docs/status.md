## 2026-08-11 (later still) — redaction posture enforced

Moataz confirmed the §3 finding and answered the brief. Logged as **decisions 027 and 028**; `docs/redaction-brief.md` §0 now carries the working spec.

**027 — redaction is baked into the pixels before upload.** The unredacted original never reaches Cloudinary. This is a security posture, not a preference: a live transform leaves the original fetchable at its base URL, one deleted path segment away. Now also stated in `CLAUDE.md` rule 6, so it is in the file read every session rather than only in a doc.

**028 — redacted images are never cropped, never a cover, never the OG image.** Enforced structurally rather than by convention:

- **Never cropped** — `CloudinaryImage` *forces* the `redacted` preset (`c_fit`) whenever `media.redacted` is true, overriding whatever the caller passed. Verified: a redacted image requested as `card` or `thumb` renders `c_fit,w_1000`, while clean images still crop normally.
- **Never a cover or OG image** — three database triggers, plus a query-layer guard that throws rather than silently dropping the cover.

Every path was tested against a live attempt, including the bypass and two controls:

| Attack | Result |
|---|---|
| Insert case file with redacted cover | blocked |
| Update cover to a redacted asset | blocked |
| **Bypass** — clean cover, then mark it redacted | blocked |
| `settings.og_image` → redacted asset | blocked |
| *Control:* clean cover / clean OG | accepted |

The database is the enforcement point because the writers are plural and growing — sync script, Layer 4 admin panel, and the Supabase table editor at any time. A rule living only in `lib/content` is a rule the table editor does not have.

**One thing worth remembering:** the triggers first went in as `SECURITY DEFINER` and tripped six advisor warnings. Supabase grants `EXECUTE` on new public functions to `anon`/`authenticated` **explicitly** via default privileges — so `revoke ... from public` was a no-op, the opposite of the earlier `rls_auto_enable()` case where the grant *was* on `PUBLIC`. Switched to `SECURITY INVOKER` (they need no elevated privileges) and revoked from the named roles. All warnings clear; triggers still fire.

## 2026-08-11 (later) — 0.8 media

### Built

`CloudinaryImage` is the only place an image URL is constructed (rule 3). Presets `thumb` / `card` / `hero` / `gallery` are live; `RedactedEvidence` renders a plain bordered surface with the shared badge and caption.

**Verified against live Cloudinary, not just a passing build** — a temporary probe route confirmed each preset returns a real image, then was removed:

| Preset | Transform | Result |
|---|---|---|
| `hero` | `c_limit,w_1200` | 200 · image/jpeg |
| `thumb` | `c_fill,w_160,h_160,g_auto` | 200 · image/jpeg |
| `card` | `c_fill,w_640,h_400,g_auto` | 200 · image/jpeg |

Aspect ratio is preserved on `limit` crops (1600×1200 → 1000×750). A missing `alt` translation omits the image entirely; a `decorative` image renders `alt=""`. Those two cases are distinguished deliberately — shipping an unlabelled image would quietly fail the accessibility baseline.

### One design decision worth recording

Built as a **server component** using `getCldImageUrl` + a plain `<img>`, not next-cloudinary's `<CldImage>`. `CldImage` calls `useState`, so importing it into the server tree fails the build — caught during verification — and would have shipped client JS for every image on an otherwise fully server-rendered site. `next/image` was also rejected: it would re-optimise what Cloudinary has already optimised.

### Redaction — still open by design

The `redacted` preset is deliberately identical to `gallery`. No blur, no pixelation, no tint. `docs/redaction-brief.md` briefs the design pass; its central point is that a **live Cloudinary transform does not remove the original** — stripping the transform segment from the URL returns the untouched image — so redaction should be baked into the asset before upload, and no unredacted original should ever reach Cloudinary.

### Blocked

`NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME` is unset. Every image is omitted until it exists.

## 2026-08-11 — Arabic corrections applied · Phase 0 foundation complete

### Arabic review pass — applied

All nine corrections are live in the database, in `supabase/migrations/0003_seed_site_chrome.sql`, and reflected in `docs/ui-strings-review.md`.

| Key | Was | Now |
|---|---|---|
| `objective` | الهدف | **الغاية** |
| `outcome` | النتيجة | **الحصيلة** |
| `redacted_notice` | محجوب بموجب اتفاقية سرية | **محجوب بموجب NDA** |
| `reflection` | تأمّل | **خلاصة** |
| `status_projected` | متوقّع | **تقديري** |
| `status_achieved` | تحقّق | **محقَّق** |
| `status_missed` | لم يتحقّق | **غير محقَّق** |
| `skip_to_content` | تخطَّ إلى المحتوى | **انتقل إلى المحتوى** |
| `case_file` | ملف حالة | **ملف المشروع** |

**Verified, not assumed:**

- **No collisions remain.** A query across all 52 strings confirms no Arabic value serves more than one key, and no English value serves more than one key — in either direction, not just the two that were reported.
- **Rendered end-to-end.** `/ar` serves `انتقل إلى المحتوى` from a clean production build.
- **No file/database drift.** `npm run check:seed-drift` reports 52 = 52.

### Length handled in CSS, not by shortening Arabic

Two tokens added, documented in `docs/design/tokens.md`:

```
--control-min-w: 8rem     /* submit button — fits جارٍ الإرسال… */
--pill-min-w:  7.5rem     /* status pill — fits غير قابل للقياس */
```

Available as `min-w-control` and `min-w-pill`. The components that consume them (Contact form, Results Table) are Phase 1.

> ⚠️ **Provisional values** — estimated from the longest Arabic string in each set, not measured against rendered text. Verify in both locales when those components land.

### New guard against a recurring failure

`npm run check:seed-drift` parses the seed migrations and compares them field by field against the database. It exists because the drift already happened once: transcribing the seed into `apply_migration` silently substituted ASCII for typographic characters, and the committed migration stopped reproducing the live data. Run it after any content change.

## Phase 0 — where the foundation stands

| Task | State |
|---|---|
| 0.1 Repo & environment | Mostly — ESLint and Vercel still outstanding |
| 0.2 Supabase schema | ✅ Applied and verified behaviourally |
| 0.3 Seed | ✅ 52 UI strings, 8 nav items, settings (3 values pending) |
| 0.4 Notion sync | Not started — blocked on stale Cervello rows |
| 0.5 Query layer | ✅ Verified, 13/13 |
| 0.6 Design tokens | ✅ Except the redaction treatment (question H) |
| 0.7 i18n + RTL shell | ✅ Except Breadcrumb, deferred to Phase 1 |
| 0.8 Cloudinary + media | ✅ Except the redaction treatment (question H) and the cloud name |
| 0.9 Instrumentation | **Next** |

### 0.7 was completed in the previous session

`/en` renders `lang=en dir=ltr`, `/ar` renders `lang=ar dir=rtl`, both prerendered as SSG, with header, footer, nav, language switch and theme toggle rendering entirely from Supabase. `/` redirects to `/en`. Verified against a running server, not just a passing build.

The only deferred piece is **Breadcrumb** — there are no nested routes for it to render on until Phase 1.

## Blockers, by who owns them

### Launch-gate blockers — Moataz

| Item | Why it blocks launch |
|---|---|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME` | Not set. Every image on the site is omitted until it exists |
| `settings.tagline` | The line under the name on the landing page — the site's one-sentence claim about itself |
| `settings.og_image` | Controls how every shared link renders on LinkedIn and WhatsApp |
| `settings.cv_url` | The footer CV link is absent until it exists |

### Design decisions — Moataz

| Item | Blocks |
|---|---|
| Redaction treatment (question H) | `RedactedEvidence`, the `redacted` Cloudinary preset. Being designed against `docs/redaction-brief.md` |
| Permanent Arabic typeface (question F) | Geist is an explicit interim (decision 020). The type scale is verified for Latin only |

### Content — Moataz

| Item | Blocks |
|---|---|
| Stale Cervello rows in Notion | Sync script correctness |
| Mini case files — in MVP-1 or cut? | Gallery scope |
| NDA asset audit + redaction rules | Every Evidence block |
| Neobiz Mobile feature lists | 2 chapters |

## Verification commands

```bash
npm run verify:content      # query layer against the live database
npm run check:seed-drift    # migration files still reproduce the database
npm run export:ui-strings   # regenerate docs/ui-strings-review.md
npm run build               # production build
```

**Note on local dev:** an incremental Turbopack build serves a stale prerender after the database changes — a corrected string will not appear until `rm -rf .next`. Content changes do not invalidate the build cache, which is what `/api/revalidate` exists for in production.

**Note on ports:** something outside these sessions serves an older build on **port 3000**. Verification runs use **3100** to avoid touching it.
