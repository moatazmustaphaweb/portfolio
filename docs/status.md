## 2026-08-11 — analytics: geography, consent-gated GA

Decisions **029** (geography) and **030** (consent-gated GA) logged.

### Geography — verified the way the referrer was

`sessions` now records `country` and `city`, taken from headers Vercel resolves at the edge. The IP never enters our code, so there is nothing to discard carefully — it is never held.

Test request carried `x-forwarded-for: 194.170.101.55`, `x-real-ip`, and `Referer: https://www.google.com/search?q=moataz+private+search`.

| Stored | Not stored |
|---|---|
| `country: AE`, `city: Dubai` | the IP address, in any column |
| `referrer_type: search` | the search query |
| `device: desktop` | the User-Agent |

A second request confirmed percent-decoding: `San%20Francisco` → `San Francisco`, `us` → `US`. A full-text scan of `sessions` and `events` for both IPs and the query string returns nothing.

Deliberately **not** collected: region, coordinates, postal code, timezone. City is already the most identifying field; anything finer is a location trail.

### Consent-gated GA

`NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID` is set to the property you sent. The gate is that the GA `<script>` is **not rendered at all** until consent is granted — stronger than GA's own Consent Mode, which loads the script and then asks it to behave. Verified: no `googletagmanager` reference in the served HTML before a choice.

The banner renders in both locales (`Allow` / `No thanks`, `أوافق` / `لا شكراً`) and mirrors via the existing logical properties. Decline is the same size and weight as accept and comes **first in the tab order**. There is no dismiss X — dismissal is not consent.

**The banner gates GA and nothing else.** Our Supabase analytics are mounted outside it and run regardless, with geography. Someone who declines is still counted. There is a comment in `ConsentBanner.tsx` warning against reusing the hook to gate anything else without deciding that thing needs consent on its own merits.

### `/how-this-site-works` copy — seeded, all four claims testable

Seeded as `ui_strings` in both languages, ⚠️ **Arabic needs your review** like the last batch:

| Claim | How it is true |
|---|---|
| I record approximate location — country and city | Verified above |
| I never store IP addresses | No column in the schema can hold one; scan returns nothing |
| I cannot follow you between visits | Session id lives in `sessionStorage`, dies with the tab |
| I use Google Analytics only if you allow it | No GA script renders before an explicit accept |

### Retention — proposal, needs your confirmation

Indefinite accumulation is not a posture. My recommendation:

**90 days for raw `sessions` and `events` rows.**

- The Door validation in Layer 2 needs a few months of data at most, not years.
- `city` + timestamp is the most identifying combination in the table; time-bounding it is the mitigation that keeps "approximate location" honest.
- Anything longer needs a reason, and "we might want it" is not one.

If you want year-over-year trends, the answer is to **pre-aggregate before deleting** — monthly counts by country, referrer type, and device, kept indefinitely — rather than keeping raw rows longer. Aggregates answer the trend questions and cannot be re-identified.

Alternative if 90 feels short: **180 days**, which still bounds it and covers two full quarters. I would not go past that without a specific need.

Implementation is a `pg_cron` job; I have not enabled it pending your answer.

### Two process notes

- **The port race cost real time.** `npm start` kept failing with `EADDRINUSE` while my kill was still settling, so several "failed" verifications were actually testing a stale server against new code. The geography code was correct from the first attempt. Using a fresh port per run is the fix; I have stopped reusing 3100.
- Combined with the stale-`.next` issue already noted, the rule for verification runs is now: `rm -rf .next`, build, start on an **unused** port, and confirm the bind before trusting a single result.

## 2026-08-11 — 0.9 instrumentation and machine legibility

### Cloudinary connected

Cloud name `vewhrkzj` is set. The account is live and ships with default sample assets, so all five presets were verified against the **real** account rather than the demo cloud — `c_limit,w_1200`, `c_fill,w_640,h_400,g_auto`, `c_fill,w_160,h_160,g_auto`, `c_limit,w_1000` and `c_fit,w_1000` all return 200 image/jpeg. A nonexistent asset returns 404 and a nonexistent cloud returns 404, so the 200s are meaningful.

### Privacy — enforced, then tested

Every claim was verified against the running endpoint, because these get published on `/how-this-site-works` and have to be true rather than approximately true.

| Request | Result |
|---|---|
| Valid `page_view` | 204, written |
| Email address under an allowlisted key | **422 rejected** |
| Disallowed key (`ip`) | **400 rejected** |
| Nested object under an allowed key | **400 rejected** |
| 13-digit string | **422 rejected** |
| Non-UUID session id | **400 rejected** |
| Unknown event type | **400 rejected** |

The rejected six wrote nothing.

**The referrer test is the one that matters.** The request carried
`Referer: https://www.google.com/search?q=secret+query`. What was stored:

```
referrer_type: "search"   device: "desktop"   locale: "en"
payload: { "route": "/en", "locale": "en" }
```

The query string never landed. Only the category. The User-Agent was read to bucket the device and discarded.

**Structural proof:** a scan of every column in `public` for anything matching `ip|agent|fingerprint|referrer|user|email|name` or typed `inet` returns exactly one row — `sessions.referrer_type`, which holds a category. There is nowhere an IP or UA *could* be stored.

Design choices behind that:

- Session id lives in **sessionStorage**, not a cookie and not localStorage. It dies with the tab. This undercounts unique visitors, and that is the correct trade: an identifier surviving the visit would make "we cannot follow you" false.
- Payload keys are **allowlisted per event type**, and values must be primitives — a nested object is how personal data arrives under an allowlisted top-level key.
- `email_capture` deliberately has **no key for the address**. The schema names the event, which makes it look like where an email would go. It is not: an address has its own consent and retention questions and belongs in its own table.

### GA is stubbed, and I'd flag it rather than wire it

Not only because the property ID is missing. GA4 sets persistent cookies, processes the visitor's IP for geolocation, collects the full User-Agent, and may enable Google Signals depending on property config. None of that is compatible with claiming "anonymous session IDs only, no IP, no fingerprinting" without qualification — and that claim is load-bearing for decision 001.

Three honest options are written up in `components/analytics/GoogleAnalytics.tsx`. My recommendation is **A: don't run GA** — the Supabase store already answers the questions that matter, and it is the one Layer 2 depends on. Nothing is collected until `NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID` is set, so the decision stays open.

### Machine legibility

- **Person JSON-LD** — from `settings`, localised (`Moataz Mustapha` / `مُعتز مصطفى`), with `description` omitted because `tagline` is still NULL. Nothing invented: this markup is quoted back verbatim by models, so rule 7 binds hardest here.
- **`llms.txt`** — generated from the database. A hand-maintained one drifts within a month and then actively misinforms the exact audience it was written for. Includes notes for summarisers: that redaction is deliberate rather than broken, and that metric labels must be preserved when quoted.
- **`sitemap.xml`** — both locales with `hreflang` alternates, so the two languages don't compete as duplicate content.
- **`robots.txt`** — GPTBot, ClaudeBot, OAI-SearchBot, PerplexityBot and Google-Extended explicitly allowed. Deliberate: the LLM read test is a launch gate, and blocking the crawlers would protect nothing while forfeiting the channel.

The read test itself can't be run yet — there is no real content to summarise. The plumbing is built so it can pass.

### Incidental

Next auto-updated to 16.3.0, which deprecates the `middleware` convention. Migrated `middleware.ts` → `proxy.ts`; warning gone, routing verified unchanged.

## 2026-08-11 (later still) — redaction posture enforced

Moataz confirmed the §3 finding and answered the brief. Logged as **decisions 027 and 028**; `docs/redaction-brief.md` §0 now carries the working spec.

**027 — redaction is baked into the pixels before upload.** The unredacted original never reaches Cloudinary. This is a security posture, not a preference: a live transform leaves the original fetchable at its base URL, one deleted path segment away. Now also stated in `CLAUDE.md` rule 6, so it is in the file read every session rather than only in a doc.

**028 — redacted images are never cropped, never a cover, never the OG image.** Enforced structurally rather than by convention:

- **Never cropped** — `CloudinaryImage` *forces* the `redacted` preset (`c_fit`) whenever `media.redacted` is true, overriding whatever the caller passed. Verified: a redacted image requested as `card` or `thumb` renders `c_fit,w_1000`, while clean images still crop normally.
- **Never a cover or OG image** — three database triggers, plus a query-layer guard that throws rather than silently dropping the cover.

Every path was tested against a live attempt, including the bypass and two controls:

| Attack | Result |
|---|---|
| Insert case file with redacted cover | blocked |
| Update cover to a redacted asset | blocked |
| **Bypass** — clean cover, then mark it redacted | blocked |
| `settings.og_image` → redacted asset | blocked |
| *Control:* clean cover / clean OG | accepted |

The database is the enforcement point because the writers are plural and growing — sync script, Layer 4 admin panel, and the Supabase table editor at any time. A rule living only in `lib/content` is a rule the table editor does not have.

**One thing worth remembering:** the triggers first went in as `SECURITY DEFINER` and tripped six advisor warnings. Supabase grants `EXECUTE` on new public functions to `anon`/`authenticated` **explicitly** via default privileges — so `revoke ... from public` was a no-op, the opposite of the earlier `rls_auto_enable()` case where the grant *was* on `PUBLIC`. Switched to `SECURITY INVOKER` (they need no elevated privileges) and revoked from the named roles. All warnings clear; triggers still fire.

## 2026-08-11 (later) — 0.8 media

### Built

`CloudinaryImage` is the only place an image URL is constructed (rule 3). Presets `thumb` / `card` / `hero` / `gallery` are live; `RedactedEvidence` renders a plain bordered surface with the shared badge and caption.

**Verified against live Cloudinary, not just a passing build** — a temporary probe route confirmed each preset returns a real image, then was removed:

| Preset | Transform | Result |
|---|---|---|
| `hero` | `c_limit,w_1200` | 200 · image/jpeg |
| `thumb` | `c_fill,w_160,h_160,g_auto` | 200 · image/jpeg |
| `card` | `c_fill,w_640,h_400,g_auto` | 200 · image/jpeg |

Aspect ratio is preserved on `limit` crops (1600×1200 → 1000×750). A missing `alt` translation omits the image entirely; a `decorative` image renders `alt=""`. Those two cases are distinguished deliberately — shipping an unlabelled image would quietly fail the accessibility baseline.

### One design decision worth recording

Built as a **server component** using `getCldImageUrl` + a plain `<img>`, not next-cloudinary's `<CldImage>`. `CldImage` calls `useState`, so importing it into the server tree fails the build — caught during verification — and would have shipped client JS for every image on an otherwise fully server-rendered site. `next/image` was also rejected: it would re-optimise what Cloudinary has already optimised.

### Redaction — still open by design

The `redacted` preset is deliberately identical to `gallery`. No blur, no pixelation, no tint. `docs/redaction-brief.md` briefs the design pass; its central point is that a **live Cloudinary transform does not remove the original** — stripping the transform segment from the URL returns the untouched image — so redaction should be baked into the asset before upload, and no unredacted original should ever reach Cloudinary.

### Blocked

`NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME` is unset. Every image is omitted until it exists.

## 2026-08-11 — Arabic corrections applied · Phase 0 foundation complete

### Arabic review pass — applied

All nine corrections are live in the database, in `supabase/migrations/0003_seed_site_chrome.sql`, and reflected in `docs/ui-strings-review.md`.

| Key | Was | Now |
|---|---|---|
| `objective` | الهدف | **الغاية** |
| `outcome` | النتيجة | **الحصيلة** |
| `redacted_notice` | محجوب بموجب اتفاقية سرية | **محجوب بموجب NDA** |
| `reflection` | تأمّل | **خلاصة** |
| `status_projected` | متوقّع | **تقديري** |
| `status_achieved` | تحقّق | **محقَّق** |
| `status_missed` | لم يتحقّق | **غير محقَّق** |
| `skip_to_content` | تخطَّ إلى المحتوى | **انتقل إلى المحتوى** |
| `case_file` | ملف حالة | **ملف المشروع** |

**Verified, not assumed:**

- **No collisions remain.** A query across all 52 strings confirms no Arabic value serves more than one key, and no English value serves more than one key — in either direction, not just the two that were reported.
- **Rendered end-to-end.** `/ar` serves `انتقل إلى المحتوى` from a clean production build.
- **No file/database drift.** `npm run check:seed-drift` reports 52 = 52.

### Length handled in CSS, not by shortening Arabic

Two tokens added, documented in `docs/design/tokens.md`:

```
--control-min-w: 8rem     /* submit button — fits جارٍ الإرسال… */
--pill-min-w:  7.5rem     /* status pill — fits غير قابل للقياس */
```

Available as `min-w-control` and `min-w-pill`. The components that consume them (Contact form, Results Table) are Phase 1.

> ⚠️ **Provisional values** — estimated from the longest Arabic string in each set, not measured against rendered text. Verify in both locales when those components land.

### New guard against a recurring failure

`npm run check:seed-drift` parses the seed migrations and compares them field by field against the database. It exists because the drift already happened once: transcribing the seed into `apply_migration` silently substituted ASCII for typographic characters, and the committed migration stopped reproducing the live data. Run it after any content change.

## Phase 0 — where the foundation stands

| Task | State |
|---|---|
| 0.1 Repo & environment | Mostly — ESLint and Vercel still outstanding |
| 0.2 Supabase schema | ✅ Applied and verified behaviourally |
| 0.3 Seed | ✅ 52 UI strings, 8 nav items, settings (3 values pending) |
| 0.4 Notion sync | Not started — blocked on stale Cervello rows |
| 0.5 Query layer | ✅ Verified, 13/13 |
| 0.6 Design tokens | ✅ Except the redaction treatment (question H) |
| 0.7 i18n + RTL shell | ✅ Except Breadcrumb, deferred to Phase 1 |
| 0.8 Cloudinary + media | ✅ Except the redaction treatment (question H) and the cloud name |
| 0.9 Instrumentation | ✅ Except the GA decision |

### 0.7 was completed in the previous session

`/en` renders `lang=en dir=ltr`, `/ar` renders `lang=ar dir=rtl`, both prerendered as SSG, with header, footer, nav, language switch and theme toggle rendering entirely from Supabase. `/` redirects to `/en`. Verified against a running server, not just a passing build.

The only deferred piece is **Breadcrumb** — there are no nested routes for it to render on until Phase 1.

## Blockers, by who owns them

### Launch-gate blockers — Moataz

| Item | Why it blocks launch |
|---|---|
| `settings.tagline` | The line under the name on the landing page — the site's one-sentence claim about itself |
| `settings.og_image` | Controls how every shared link renders on LinkedIn and WhatsApp |
| `settings.cv_url` | The footer CV link is absent until it exists |

### Design decisions — Moataz

| Item | Blocks |
|---|---|
| Redaction treatment (question H) | `RedactedEvidence`, the `redacted` Cloudinary preset. Being designed against `docs/redaction-brief.md` |
| Permanent Arabic typeface (question F) | Geist is an explicit interim (decision 020). The type scale is verified for Latin only |

### Content — Moataz

| Item | Blocks |
|---|---|
| Stale Cervello rows in Notion | Sync script correctness |
| Mini case files — in MVP-1 or cut? | Gallery scope |
| NDA asset audit + redaction rules | Every Evidence block |
| Neobiz Mobile feature lists | 2 chapters |

---

## Verification commands

```bash
npm run verify:content      # query layer against the live database
npm run check:seed-drift    # migration files still reproduce the database
npm run export:ui-strings   # regenerate docs/ui-strings-review.md
npm run build               # production build
```

**Note on local dev:** an incremental Turbopack build serves a stale prerender after the database changes — a corrected string will not appear until `rm -rf .next`. Content changes do not invalidate the build cache, which is what `/api/revalidate` exists for in production.

**Note on ports:** something outside these sessions serves an older build on **port 3000**. Verification runs use **3100** to avoid touching it.
